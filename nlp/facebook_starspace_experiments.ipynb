            "Poh Ern Shih Temple\tPoh Ern Shih ( ) is located on a small hilltop at Chwee Chian Road , off Pasir Panjang Road , on Singapore 's southern coast .\tThe Buddhist temple was built as a memorial to those who lost their lives during the Battle of Pasir Panjang in 1942 , villagers as well as Allied and Japanese soldiers .\tThe temple 's first abbot , Sumangalo , an American Theravadin monk , was the first Westerner to be appointed abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore .\tFollowing a major development project which began in 2003 , Poh Ern Shih became the first religious building in the country to incorporate both eco-friendly and elderly-friendly features .\tTogether with its partner , the Buddhist Fellowship , the temple conducts programmes such as Dharma talks , Sutta discussions and meditation courses in Chinese and English for the Buddhist community .\tPoh Ern Shih is located on the top of Chwee Chian Hill , off Pasir Panjang Road , on Singapore 's southern coast .\tFacing the hilltop is Bukit Chandu ( 'Opium Hill ' in Malay ) , where the British East India Company had an opium factory to process raw opium from the Golden Triangle for sale to China and South East Asia in the 19th century .\tTo protect its military facilities in the vicinity , the British colonial government placed heavy artillery guns on Chwee Chian Hill before the onset of the Second World War , in anticipation of seaborne attacks by the Japanese off the coast of Pasir Panjang .\tDuring the Battle of Pasir Panjang , Bukit Chandu was the last bastion of the 1st and 2nd Battalion Malay Regiment who , together with the 2nd Loyals Regiment , defended the western and southern parts of Singapore from 8–14 February 1942 .\tDespite running low on ammunition and food , the Malay Regiments put up strong resistance , inflicting a heavy toll on the Japanese invaders .\tOutnumbered , the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese forces .\tA Malay officer , Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi , was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese , before being executed .\tThe story of his heroism became well known throughout Singapore .\tBased on the concept of liberating the spirits of the soldiers and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II , the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed on the site of the bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill .\tIt was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng ( 1888—1966 ) , as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva .\tLee was born in Yong Choon county , Fujian province , in China .\tHe joined his father in Negri Sembilan in his youth , before moving to Singapore to set up his own property business .\tHe was very successful , and achieved positions of leadership in the local Chinese community .\tHe was widely known as one of the co-founders of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation ( OCBC ) , and was its acting chairman during the Japanese Occupation .\tAs one of the early Buddhist pioneers , Lee was also involved in the foundation of the Buddhist Publications Circulation Centre in 1933 , and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge in 1934 .\tVenerable Sumangalo ( 1903—1963 ) was born as Robert Stuart Clifton in Birmingham , Alabama in the United States in 1903 .\tAfter receiving his Doctorate in Literature , he lectured on Buddhism in the United States before moving to Asia to further his study of Buddhism .\tIn 1957 , he joined the Theravada Order in Laos and received the monastic name Sumangalo , meaning `` very auspicious '' .\tHe then left for Malaya and later visited Singapore on a Dharma tour in late 1959 with another American Buddhist monk , Venerable Susiddhi .\tThrough his efforts , a number of Youth Circles and Sunday schools were set up locally .\tIn January 1959 he was offered the honorary abbotship of Poh Ern Shih , thus becoming the first Westerner to be the abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore .\tWhile in Singapore , he assisted Pitt Chin Hui in her translation of the `` Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra '' from Chinese to English .\tHe returned to Malaya and spent his later years at Penang Buddhist Association , where most of his Dharma lectures were held .\tHis lectures were later compiled in English and Chinese and are still freely distributed .\tVenerable Sumangalo died on 6 February 1963 and was cremated in Penang .\tPitt Chin Hui ( 1906—1981 ) was born to a wealthy family in Guangzhou , China .\tShe was the youngest child of the family , and was taken by her mother to Penang to receive her early education .\tIn 1924 , she sat for the Senior Cambridge Examination , and while waiting for the examination results she became an English teacher at the Fujian Girls ' School .\tIn 1927 , she left for further studies at the Zhongshan University in Guangzhou .\tHowever , she terminated her tertiary studies and returned to Penang when her mother became seriously ill .\tWhile in Penang , she attended Dharma lectures by Venerable Taixu and his disciple , Venerable Cihang , at the Kek Lok Si Temple .\tPitt subsequently became one of Cihang 's disciples , and studied under him .\tShe was responsible for setting up the Maha Bodhi School in Penang and Singapore ( 1946 ) , to promote Buddhist education to the young .\tAlong with her school duties , Pitt was also an active voluntary worker in the Buddhist community .\tIn December 1959 , Pitt embarked on the task of translating the `` Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra '' from Chinese to English at Poh Ern Shih , so that it would be accessible to the English-educated .\tVenerable Sumangalo assisted Pitt in her translation tasks , as well as offering suggestions for improving the English version .\tIn 1964 , Pitt was awarded the Public Service Star—BBM ( Bintang Bakti Masharakat ) —by Encik Yusof bin Ishak , the First President of the Republic of Singapore .\tIn 1973 , she was appointed as Justice of the Peace by the Second President Dr .\tBenjamin Henry Sheares .\tPitt Chin Hui was also a Vice-President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists .\tShe died in 1981 while on a trip in India .\tTo allow for expansion , the old premises were demolished .\tReconstruction began in 2003 , and the office wing was completed in April 2007 , in phase 1 of the project .\tThe new six-storey building was designed by Lee Coo , who is also the architect behind the Venerable Hong Choon Memorial Hall of the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple .\tOccupying a freehold site , the new Poh Ern Shih is an architectural synthesis of classical features combined with modern eco-friendly technology .\tConscious that a large percentage of its devotees were in their 60s , the Honorary President/Director of Poh Ern Shih , Lee Boon Siong , a retired lawyer , grandson of the temple 's founder , and its chief architect , strove to ensure that the temple was accessible to the elderly and those who use wheelchairs .\tA gentle driveway stretches from the gates to the upper levels of the temple , and every storey of the building has level flooring .\tThe lavatory cubicles are fitted with easily reached `` call-for-help '' buttons , and the doors are designed so that they can be unlocked from the outside in the case of emergency .\tThe temple takes advantage of Singapore 's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop .\tThey are the poly-crystalline silicon solar array , mono-crystalline silicon solar array and amorphous silicon solar array .\tPoh Ern Shih 's water is heated by its solar panels , and its night lighting is powered by electricity converted from solar energy , With its breezy location , wind generators have also been erected to convert wind activity into electricity .\tThe rainwater which falls on Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters and used to irrigate the temple grounds , as well as to generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs .\tThe electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators .\tA purification system is also being installed , so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable .\tIn line with the aim to make use of renewable resources , the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo .\tBamboo is considered to one of the most ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring , because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree .\tThere is therefore no need for replanting , and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years , ready to be harvested again .\tThe second phase of the temple was completed in late 2008 , featuring a new Main Ksitigarbha Prayer Hall as well as a Guanyin Meditation Hall with lapis lazuli statues and a 7-storey stupa .\tTo reinvigorate itself and attract younger blood , Poh Ern Shih entered into a partnership with the Buddhist Fellowship\t, a non-sectarian Buddhist organisation known locally for its revolutionary projects and activities intended to ensure that the Dharma is propagated in contemporary language and form .\tThe Fellowship—whose more than 2,000 members are mainly English-speaking professionals , mostly under 45 years of age—initially rented space at Eton House in Paya Lebar .\tLee Boon Siong contacted the Fellowship 's President , Angie Monksfield , a Chinese Singaporean married to an English Catholic , offering use of the temple premises .\tIn early 2007 , Angie took up the offer after the rent for Eton House was raised by 57 per cent—a sum which was difficult for the fellowship to afford .\tThe rent charged by the temple is the same as that which the Fellowship was paying before the increase demanded by its previous landlord .\tThe Fellowship moved into its of space in Poh Ern Shih on 29 May 2007 .\tThe event was marked by an opening ceremony attended by Khaw Boon Wan , Minister for Health , and the Fellowship 's two spiritual patrons , Ajahn Brahm and Venerable Kwang Sheng , Abbot of Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple .\tThe group conducts programmes such as Dharma talks , Sutta discussions and meditation courses

Douglas and the dissent written by Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge .\tThe decision was substantially overturned in `` Braden v .\t30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky '' ( 1973 ) , which held that territorial jurisdiction is derived from the location of the custodian , those responsible for the indictment , rather than the location of the detention .\tThe United States District Court for the District of Columbia had been petitioned by 120 German detainees being held on Ellis Island for a writ of `` habeas corpus '' to challenge in court their detention and imminent deportation .\tThe deportation order had been issued by Attorney General Tom C. Clark , using wartime powers granted by President Harry Truman in the waning months of World War II .\tThe detainees argued the US Court for DC had jurisdiction because they were being held `` subject to the custody and control '' of the Attorney General .\tThe government argued their case should be dismissed because Ellis Island is outside the territorial confines of the District of Columbia .\tThe Supreme Court , the federal appeals courts , and the federal district courts had the power to grant writs of `` habeas corpus '' `` within their respective jurisdictions '' ; the case hinged on whether the words `` within their respective jurisdictions '' implied a territorial limitation .\tThe court held that they did .\tJudge Wiley Blount Rutledge was concerned that the Court 's decision was narrowly construing the great writ of habeas corpus .\tHe wrote :\t`` If this is or is to become the law , the full ramifications of the decision are difficult to foresee .\tIt would seem that a great contraction of the writ 's classic scope and exposition has taken place,2 and much of its historic efficacy may have been destroyed .\tFor if absence of the body from the jurisdiction is alone conclusive against existence of power to issue the writ , what of the case where the place of imprisonment , whether by private or public action , is unknown ?\tWhat also of the situation where that place is located in one district , but the jailer is present in and can be served with process only in another ? 3 And if the place of detention lies wholly outside the territorial limits of any federal jurisdiction , although the person or persons exercising restraint are clearly within reach of such authority , is there to be no remedy , even though it is American citizens who are wrongfully deprived of their liberty and Americans answerable to no other power who deprive them of it , whether purporting to act officially or otherwise ?\tIn all these cases may the jailers stand in defiance of federal judicial power , and plead either the accident of the locus of detention outside the court 's territorial limitations , or their own astuteness in so selecting the place , to nullify judicial competence ?

            "Pontiac 's War\tPontiac 's War , Pontiac 's Conspiracy , or Pontiac 's Rebellion was a war that was launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes primarily from the Great Lakes region , the Illinois Country , and Ohio Country who were dissatisfied with British postwar policies in the Great Lakes region after the British victory in the French and Indian War ( 1754–1763 ) .\tWarriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region .\tThe war is named after the Odawa leader Pontiac , the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict .\tThe war began in May 1763 when Native Americans , offended by the policies of British General Jeffrey Amherst , attacked a number of British forts and settlements .\tEight forts were destroyed , and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured , with many more fleeing the region .\tHostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years .\tNative Americans were unable to drive away the British , but the uprising prompted the British government to modify the policies that had provoked the conflict .\tWarfare on the North American frontier was brutal , and the killing of prisoners , the targeting of civilians , and other atrocities were widespread .\tThe ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was a reflection of a growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans .\tContrary to popular belief , the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac 's War , though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation 's Indian clauses .\tThis proved unpopular with British colonists , and may have been one of the early contributing factors to the American Revolution .\tThe conflict is named after its most famous participant , the Ottawa leader Pontiac ; variations include `` Pontiac 's War '' , `` Pontiac 's Rebellion '' , and `` Pontiac 's Uprising '' .\tAn early name for the war was the `` Kiyasuta and Pontiac War '' , `` Kiyasuta '' being an alternate spelling for Guyasuta , an influential Seneca/Mingo leader .\tThe war became widely known as `` Pontiac 's Conspiracy '' after the publication in 1851 of Francis Parkman 's `` The Conspiracy of Pontiac '' .\tParkman 's influential book , the definitive account of the war for nearly a century , is still in print .\tIn the 20th century , some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated the extent of Pontiac 's influence in the conflict and that it was misleading to name the war after Pontiac .\tFor example , in 1988 Francis Jennings wrote : `` In Francis Parkman 's murky mind the backwoods plots emanated from one savage genius , the Ottawa chief Pontiac , and thus they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac , ' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance ' involving many tribes . ''\tAlternate titles for the war have been proposed , but historians generally continue to refer to the war by the familiar names , with `` Pontiac 's War '' probably the most commonly used .\t`` Pontiac 's Conspiracy '' is now infrequently used by scholars .\tIn the decades before Pontiac 's Rebellion , France and Great Britain participated in a series of wars in Europe that also involved the French and Indian Wars in North America .\tThe largest of these wars was the worldwide Seven Years ' War , in which France lost New France in North America to Great Britain .\tPeace with the Shawnee and Lenape who had been combatants came in 1758 with the Treaty of Easton , where the British promised not to settle further beyond the ridge of the Alleghenies - a demarcation later to be confirmed by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , though it was little respected .\tMost fighting in the North American theater of the war , generally referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States , came to an end after British General Jeffrey Amherst captured Montreal , the last important French settlement , in 1760 .\tBritish troops proceeded to occupy the various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French .\tEven before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) , the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory .\tWhile the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans , the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people .\tBefore long , Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors .\tNative Americans involved in Pontiac 's Rebellion lived in a vaguely defined region of New France known as the `` pays d'en haut '' ( `` the upper country '' ) , which was claimed by France until the Paris peace treaty of 1763 .\tNative Americans of the `` pays d'en haut '' were from many different tribes .\tAt this time and place , a `` tribe '' was a linguistic or ethnic group rather than a political unit .\tNo chief spoke for an entire tribe , and no tribe acted in unison .\tFor example , Ottawas did not go to war as a tribe : some Ottawa leaders chose to do so , while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict .\tThe tribes of the `` pays d'en haut '' consisted of three basic groups .\tThe first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region : Ojibwe , Odawa , and Potawatomi , who spoke Algonquian languages ; and the Huron , who spoke an Iroquoian language .\tThey had long been allied with French `` habitants '' , with whom they lived , traded , and intermarried .\tGreat Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America .\tWhen a British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760 , local Native Americans cautioned them that `` this country was given by God to the Indians . ''\tThe second group was made up of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country , which included the Miami , Wea , Kickapoo , Mascouten , and Piankashaw .\tLike the Great Lakes tribes , these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French .\tThroughout the war , the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country , which was on the remote western edge of the conflict .\tThe Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British .\tThe third group was made up of tribes of the Ohio Country : Delawares ( Lenape ) , Shawnee , Wyandot , and Mingo .\tThese people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British , French , and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area .\tUnlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes , Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime .\tThey had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British .\tThey made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country .\tBut after the departure of the French , the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them , and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British .\tOutside the `` pays d'en haut '' , most warriors of the influential Iroquois Confederacy did not participate in Pontiac 's War because of their alliance with the British , known as the Covenant Chain .\tHowever , the westernmost Iroquois nation , the Seneca tribe , had become disaffected with the alliance .\tAs early as 1761 , the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes , urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British .\tWhen the war finally came in 1763 , many Seneca were quick to take action .\tGeneral Amherst , the British commander-in-chief in North America , was in overall charge of administering policy towards Native Americans , which involved both military matters and regulation of the fur trade .\tAmherst believed that with France out of the picture , the Native Americans would have no other choice than to accept British rule .\tHe also believed that they were incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army ; therefore , of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America , only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted .\tAmherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin , commander at Fort Detroit , made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans .\tNative Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs .\tAdditional Native resentment resulted from Amherst 's decision in February 1761 to cut back on the gifts given to the Native Americans .\tGift giving had been an integral part of the relationship between the French and the tribes of the `` pays d'en haut '' .\tFollowing a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning , the French gave presents ( such as guns , knives , tobacco , and clothing ) to village chiefs , who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people .\tBy this process , the village chiefs gained stature among their people , and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French .\tAmherst , however , considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary , especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France .\tMany Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies .\tAmherst also began to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Native Americans .\tWhile the French had always made these supplies available , Amherst did not trust the Native Americans , particularly after the `` Cherokee Rebellion '' of 1761 , in which Cherokee warriors took up arms against their former British allies .\tAs the Cherokee war effort had collapsed because of a shortage of gunpowder , so Amherst hoped that future uprisings could be prevented by restricting gunpowder .\tThis created resentment and hardship because gunpowder and ammunition were wanted by native men because it helped them to provide game for their families and skins for the fur trade .\tMany Native Americans began to believe that the British were disarming them as a prelude to making war upon them .\tSir William Johnson , the Superintendent of the Indian Department , tried to warn Amherst of the dangers of cutting back on gifts and gunpowder , to no avail .\tLand was also an issue in the coming of the war .\tWhile the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who seasonally engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few , there seemed to be no end of settlers in the British colonies , who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it .\tShawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east , and this motivated their involvement in the war .\tOn the other hand , Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement , although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east .\tHistorian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac 's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers , and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war .\tDowd believes that the presence , attitude , and policies of the British Army , which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting , were more important factors .\tAlso contributing to the outbreak of war was a religious awakening which swept through Native settlements in the early 1760s .\tThe movement was fed by discontent with the British as well as food shortages and epidemic disease .\tThe most influential individual in this phenomenon was Neolin , known as the `` Delaware Prophet '' , who called upon Native Americans to shun the trade goods , alcohol , and weapons of the whites .\tMerging elements from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs , Neolin told listeners that the Master of Life was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men , and that the British posed a threat to their very existence .\t`` If you suffer the English among you , '' said Neolin , `` you are dead men .\tSickness , smallpox , and their poison [ alcohol ] will destroy you entirely . ''\tIt was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control .\tAlthough fighting in Pontiac 's Rebellion began in 1763 , rumors reached British officials as early as 1761 that discontented Native Americans were planning an attack .\tSenecas of the Ohio Country ( Mingos ) circulated messages ( `` war belts '' made of wampum ) which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British .\tThe Mingos , led by Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris , were concerned about being surrounded by British forts .\tSimilar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country .\tThe Native Americans were not unified , however , and in June 1761 , Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot .\tAfter William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761 a tenuous peace was maintained , but war belts continued to circulate .\tViolence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 of the imminent French cession of the `` pays d'en haut '' to the British .\tThe war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac , and quickly spread throughout the region .\tEight British forts were taken ; others , including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt , were unsuccessfully besieged .\tFrancis Parkman 's `` The Conspiracy of Pontiac '' portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac .\tParkman 's interpretation remains well known , but other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall `` conspiracy '' .\tThe prevailing view among scholars today is that , rather than being planned in advance , the uprising spread as word of Pontiac 's actions at Detroit traveled throughout the `` pays d'en haut '' , inspiring already discontented Native Americans to join the revolt .\tThe attacks on British forts were not simultaneous : most Ohio Native Americans did not enter the war until nearly a month after the beginning of Pontiac 's siege at Detroit .\tParkman also believed that Pontiac 's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans in order to make trouble for the British .\tThis belief was widely held by British officials at the time , but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising .\t( The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years ' War were still in circulation in some Native villages . )\tRather than the French stirring up the Native Americans , some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French .\tPontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance ; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village .\tAll of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British .\tAlthough some French colonists and traders supported the uprising , the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives .\tHistorian Richard Middleton ( 2007 ) argues that Pontiac 's vision , courage , persistence , and organizational abilities allowed him to activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight successfully against the British .\tThough the idea to gain independence for all Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains did not originate with him but with two Seneca leaders , Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta , by February 1763 Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea .\tAt an emergency council meeting , Pontiac clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to galvanize other nations into the military operation that he helped lead , in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure .\tHe achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts : first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac ; and then after the failure to seize Detroit by stratagem , to the Mingo ( Seneca ) on the upper Allegheny River , the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt , and the more westerly Miami , Kickapoo , Piankashaw and Wea peoples .\tOn April 27 , 1763 , Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the Ecorse River , in what is now Lincoln Park , Michigan , about 10 miles ( 15 km ) southwest of Detroit .\tUsing the teachings of Neolin to inspire his listeners , Pontiac convinced a number of Ottawas , Ojibwas , Potawatomis , and Hurons to join him in an attempt to seize Fort Detroit .\tOn May 1 , Pontiac visited the fort with 50 Ottawas in order to assess the strength of the garrison .\tAccording to a French chronicler , in a second council Pontiac proclaimed :\tIt is important for us , my brothers , that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us .\tYou see as well as I that we can no longer supply our needs , as we have done from our brothers , the French ... Therefore , my brothers , we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer .\tNothing prevents us ; they are few in numbers , and we can accomplish it .\tHoping to take the stronghold by surprise , on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons .\tThe British had learned of Pontiac 's plan , however , and were armed and ready .\tHis tactic foiled , Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and , two days later , laid siege to the fort .\tPontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort , including women and children .\tOne of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized , as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures .\tThe violence was directed at the British ; French colonists were generally left alone .\tEventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege .\tMeanwhile , on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee .\tAfter receiving reinforcements , the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac 's encampment .\tBut Pontiac was ready and waiting , and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31 , 1763 .\tNevertheless , the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate , and Pontiac 's influence among his followers began to wane .\tGroups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege , some of them making peace with the British before departing .\tOn October 31 , 1763 , finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit , Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River , where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British .\tBefore other British outposts had learned about Pontiac 's siege at Detroit , Native Americans captured five small forts in a series of attacks between May 16 and June 2 .\tThe first to be taken was Fort Sandusky , a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie .\tIt had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst , despite the objections of local Wyandots , who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down .\tOn May 16 , 1763 , a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council , the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier .\tThey seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers , as well as British traders at the fort .\tThese were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed in the early stages of the war .\tThe dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground .\tFort St .\tJoseph ( the site of present-day Niles , Michigan ) was captured on May 25 , 1763 , by the same method as at Sandusky .\tPotawatomis seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison outright .\tFort Miami ( on the site of present Fort Wayne , Indiana ) was the third fort to fall .\tOn May 27 , 1763 , the commander was lured out of the fort by his Native mistress and shot dead by Miami Native Americans .\tThe nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded .\tIn the Illinois Country , , Kickapoos , and Mascoutens took Fort Ouiatenon ( about west of present Lafayette , Indiana ) on June 1 , 1763 .\tThey lured soldiers outside for a council , and took the 20-man garrison captive without bloodshed .\tThe Native Americans around Fort Ouiatenon had good relations with the British garrison , but emissaries from Pontiac at Detroit had convinced them to strike .\tThe warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort , saying that `` they were obliged to do it by the other Nations . ''\tIn contrast with other forts , the Natives did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon .\tThe fifth fort to fall , Fort Michilimackinac ( present Mackinaw City , Michigan ) , was the largest fort taken by surprise .\tOn June 2 , 1763 , local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball ( a forerunner of lacrosse ) with visiting Sauks .\tThe soldiers watched the game , as they had done on previous occasions .\tThe ball was hit through the open gate of the fort ; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort .\tThe warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle ; later they killed five more in ritual torture .\tThree forts in the Ohio Country were taken in a second wave of attacks in mid-June .\tIroquois Senecas took Fort Venango ( near the site of the present Franklin , Pennsylvania ) around June 16 , 1763 .\tThey killed the entire 12-man garrison outright , keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas .\tAfter that , they ritually burned him at the stake .\tPossibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf ( on the site of Waterford , Pennsylvania ) on June 18 , but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt .\tOn June 19 , 1763 , about 250 Ottawa , Ojibwa , Wyandot , and Seneca warriors surrounded Fort Presque Isle ( on the site of Erie , Pennsylvania ) , the eighth and final fort to fall .\tAfter holding out for two days , the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered , on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt .\tThe warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort .\tColonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war .\tNearly 550 people crowded inside , including more than 200 women and children .\tSimeon Ecuyer , the Swiss-born British officer in command , wrote that `` We are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease ... ; the smallpox is among us . ''\tFort Pitt was attacked on June 22 , 1763 , primarily by Delawares .\tToo strong to be taken by force , the fort was kept under siege throughout July .\tMeanwhile , Delaware and Shawnee war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania , taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms .\tTwo smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east , Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier , were sporadically fired upon throughout the conflict , but were never taken .\tBefore the war , Amherst had dismissed the possibility that the Native Americans would offer any effective resistance to British rule , but that summer he found the military situation becoming increasingly grim .\tHe ordered subordinates to `` immediately ... put to death '' captured enemy Native American warriors .\tTo Colonel Henry Bouquet at Lancaster , Pennsylvania , who was preparing to lead an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt , Amherst wrote on about June 29 , 1763 : `` Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians ?\tWe must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them . ''\tBouquet responded to Amherst ( summer of 1763 ) :\t`` P.S .\tI will try to inocculate [ sic ] the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands , taking care however not to get the disease myself .\tAs it is pity to oppose good men against them , I wish we could make use of the Spaniard 's Method , and hunt them with English Dogs .\tSupported by Rangers , and some Light Horse , who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that Vermine . ''\tIn a postscript , Amherst replied :\t`` P.S .\tYou will Do well to try to Innoculate [ sic ] the Indians by means of Blankets , as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race .\tI should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect , but England is at too great a Distance to think of that at present . ''\tOfficers at the besieged Fort Pitt had already attempted to do what Amherst and Bouquet were discussing , apparently on their own initiative .\tDuring a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24 , 1763 , Ecuyer gave Delaware representatives , Turtleheart and Mamaltee , two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox , hoping to spread the disease to the Native Americans in order to `` extirpate '' them from the territory .\tWilliam Trent , the militia commander , left records that showed the purpose of giving the blankets was `` to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians . ''\tTurtleheart and Killbuck would later represent the Delaware at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 .\tOn July 22 , Trent writes , `` Gray Eyes , Wingenum , Turtle 's Heart and Mamaultee , came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council , that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day '' .\tThere are eyewitness reports that outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases had plagued the Ohio Native Americans in the years prior to the siege of Fort Pitt .\tColonists also caught smallpox from Native Americans at a peace conference in 1759 which then led to an epidemic in Charleston and the surrounding areas in South Carolina .\tHistorians are at odds as to how much damage the attempt to spread smallpox at Fort Pitt caused .\tHistorian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was `` unquestionably successful and effective '' and inflicted great damage to the Native Americans .\tHistorian Michael McConnell writes that , `` Ironically , British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon may not have been either necessary or particularly effective '' , noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means , and Native Americans were familiar with the disease and adept at isolating the infected .\tHistorians widely agree that smallpox devastated the Native American population .\tIt is estimated that 400,000-500,000 ( possibly up to 1.5 million ) Native Americans died during and years after the Pontiac 's War , mostly from smallpox ,\tOn August 1 , 1763 , most of the Native Americans broke off the siege at Fort Pitt in order to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet .\tOn August 5 , these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run .\tAlthough his force suffered heavy casualties , Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20 , bringing the siege to an end .\tHis victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies—church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia—and praised by King George .\tThis victory was soon followed by a costly defeat .\tFort Niagara , one of the most important western forts , was not assaulted , but on September 14 , 1763 , at least 300 Senecas , Ottawas , and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the Niagara Falls portage .\tTwo companies sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train were also defeated .\tMore than 70 soldiers and teamsters were killed in these actions , which Anglo-Americans called the `` Devil 's Hole Massacre '' , the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war .\tThe violence and terror of Pontiac 's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them .\tThis discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys , so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton ( or Paxtang ) .\tThe Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements .\tPrompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga , on December 14 , 1763 , a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there .\tPennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster , but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them .\tGovernor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers , but no one came forward to identify them .\tThe Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania , many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection .\tSeveral hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764 , where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence .\tBenjamin Franklin , who had helped organize the local militia , negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis .\tFranklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys .\t`` If an `` Indian '' injures me , '' he asked , `` does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all `` Indians '' ? ''\tOne leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who would be killed in the Wyoming Massacre of 1778 .\tNative American raids on frontier settlements escalated in the spring and summer of 1764 .\tThe hardest hit colony that year was Virginia , where more raids occurred on July 26 , when four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County , Pennsylvania .\tIncidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly , with the approval of Governor Penn , to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War , which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten , including women .\tGeneral Amherst , held responsible for the uprising by the Board of Trade , was recalled to London in August 1763 and replaced by Major General Thomas Gage .\tIn 1764 , Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion , rescue British prisoners , and arrest the Native Americans responsible for the war .\tAccording to historian Fred Anderson , Gage 's campaign , which had been designed by Amherst , prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Native Americans rather than ending the war .\tGage 's one significant departure from Amherst 's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara , giving those Native Americans who were ready to `` bury the hatchet '' a chance to do so .\tFrom July to August 1764 , Johnson negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance , primarily Iroquois .\tAlthough most Iroquois had stayed out of the war , Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British , and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance .\tAs restitution for the Devil 's Hole ambush , the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British .\tJohnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans .\tThis Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley , but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired .\tHaving secured the area around Fort Niagara , the British launched two military expeditions into the west .\tThe first expedition , led by Colonel John Bradstreet , was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit .\tBradstreet was to subdue the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country .\tThe second expedition , commanded by Colonel Bouquet , was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country .\tBradstreet set out from Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson .\tBradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force , and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12 , he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta .\tBradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce , and by agreeing to halt Bouquet 's expedition , which had not yet left Fort Pitt .\tGage , Johnson , and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done .\tGage rejected the treaty , believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country .\tGage may have been correct : the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September , and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war .\tBradstreet continued westward , as yet unaware that his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors .\tHe reached Fort Detroit on August 26 , where he negotiated another treaty .\tIn an attempt to discredit Pontiac , who was not present , Bradstreet chopped up a peace belt the Ottawa leader had sent to the meeting .\tAccording to historian Richard White , `` such an act , roughly equivalent to a European ambassador 's urinating on a proposed treaty , had shocked and offended the gathered Indians . ''\tBradstreet also claimed that the Native Americans had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations , but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Native Americans and that further councils would be needed .\tAlthough Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region , his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive .\tColonel Bouquet , delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia , finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3 , 1764 , with 1,150 men .\tHe marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country , within striking distance of a number of native villages .\tNow that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit , the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and , with some exceptions , ready to make peace .\tIn a council which began on October 17 , Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives , including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War .\tGuyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives , many of whom had been adopted into Native families .\tBecause not all of the captives were present , the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned .\tThe Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson , which was finalized in July 1765 .\tAlthough the military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions , Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country , where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French .\tA Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region , temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence .\tKaské traveled as far south as New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British .\tIn 1765 , the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means .\tAs Gage commented to one of his officers , he was determined to have `` none our enemy '' among the Indian peoples , and that included Pontiac , to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks .\tPontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet 's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans .\tJohnson 's deputy , George Croghan , accordingly travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765 , and although he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens , he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac .\tWhile Charlot Kaské wanted to burn Croghan at the stake , Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York , where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25 , 1766 .\tIt was hardly a surrender : no lands were ceded , no prisoners returned , and no hostages were taken .\tRather than accept British sovereignty , Kaské left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees .\tThe total loss of life resulting from Pontiac 's War is unknown .\tAbout 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death .\tGeorge Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured , a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers `` killed '' .\tThe violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes .\tNative American losses went mostly unrecorded .\tPontiac 's War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans , but scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate : while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British , the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans .\tNegotiation and accommodation , rather than success on the battlefield , ultimately brought an end to the war .\tThe Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst 's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance .\tRelations between British colonists and Native Americans , which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War , reached a new low during Pontiac 's Rebellion .\tAccording to historian David Dixon , `` Pontiac 's War was unprecedented for its awful violence , as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism . ''\tHistorian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British , and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst , as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing .\tPeople on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other .\tAccording to Richter , the war saw the emergence of `` the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians , ' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites , ' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other . ''\tThe British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans must be kept apart .\tOn October 7 , 1763 , the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris .\tThe Proclamation , already in the works when Pontiac 's War erupted , was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London .\tOfficials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard , and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge ( i.e. , the Eastern Divide ) , creating a vast 'Indian Reserve ' that stretched from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec .\tIt thus confirmed the antebellum demarcation that had been set by the Treaty of Easton in 1758 .\tBy forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands , the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac 's Rebellion .\t`` The Royal Proclamation , '' writes historian Colin Calloway , `` reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations . ''\tThe effects of Pontiac 's War were long-lasting .\tBecause the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied , it has been called the Native Americans ' `` Bill of Rights '' , and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and First Nations .\tFor British colonists and land speculators , however , the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory—western lands—that had been won in the war with France .\tThe resentment which this created undermined colonial attachment to the Empire , contributing to the coming of the American Revolution .\tAccording to Colin Calloway , `` Pontiac 's Revolt was not the last American war for independence—American colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later , prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac 's . ''\tFor Native Americans , Pontiac 's War demonstrated the possibilities of pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion .\tAlthough the conflict divided tribes and villages , the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America , and was the first war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans .\tThe Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward , and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements .\tBeginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767 , in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant , Alexander McGillivray , Blue Jacket , and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac 's War .\n",

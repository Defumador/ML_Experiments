# Deep Learning Experiments

This repository will contain code's mainly related to my personal experiances while learning ML and Deep Learning. All will contain various examples and learning. 

This repo is mainly for myself to recollect and also share my journey and experiances with Deep Learning.

### NLP / Deep Learning ###
Learning NLP through deep learning

- ##### Keras #####
  - [Golve Embedding with Keras CNN/LSTM](nlp/golve_vectors_with_keras_deep_nets.ipynb) Got good results using GloVe vectors with LSTM but it takes time to train the network. *Should come back to above later and test this with more relevent data*
  - [Spacy Embedding with Keras](nlp/spacy_vectors_with_keras_deep_nets.ipynb) Just trying out spacy embedding instead of GloVe. Altough spacy uses GloVe internally, it's just easier to use just a single library.  

### Pytorch ###

- [Pytorch Basics Part2](pytorch/101/pytorch_getting_started_part2.ipynb) Doing simple linear regression 
- [Pytroch Simple NN on MNIST Dataset](pytorch/101/pytorch_basics_LR_on_MNIST_Dataset.ipynb)

### Keras ###
I found keras easy to start with when working with M/L and understand basics of neural networks. 
- [Keras 101](keras/Keras_First_Neural_Net_101.ipynb)
- [Keras Simple CNN and VGG16 Transfer Learning](keras/keras_very_simple_cnn_and_vgg16_transfer_learning.ipynb) Taken images from flipkart to classify images between tshirt/jeans
- [Keras NLP Text Classification With Simple FF Network Word2Vec + TF-IDF](keras/simple_FF_deep_learning_classifier_with_word2vec_embedding_+_TF_IDF.ipynb) Using a very simple NN to expriment text classification and using word2vec embeddings
- [LSTM/CNN Text Classification using word2vec](keras/deep_learning_word2vec_model_with_CNN,_LSTM.ipynb) Trying out LSTM/CNN modules to classify text 

### ML ###
Various expriments with Data Science and ML
- [PCA/t-Sine Data Visualization](ml/PCA,_t_sine_data_visualization.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression for Text Classification](ml/logistic_regression_with_word2vec.ipynb) Using sklearn for LR and word2vec for embeddings together with Mean/TF-IDF
- [SkLean Classifiers Experiments SVC/SGD/Naive](ml/ski_lean_ml_classifier_naive_bayes_random_forest_svc_sgd.ipynb)

### NLP Basics ###
Understanding basics of NLP
- [NLP Basics](nlp/101/nlp_getting_started.ipynb) 
- [Bag of Words](nlp/101/count_vectorize_bag_of_words.ipynb)
- [TF-IDF](nlp/101/tf_idf_experments.ipynb)
- [Word2Vec](nlp/101/word2vec_experiments.ipynb)  Good results to understand word2vec
- [Word2Vec Visualize Data](nlp/101/word2vec_experiments_plotting_and_data_visualization.ipynb) Plotting word2vec data to understand

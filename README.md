# ML/AI Experiments

This repository will contain code's mainly related to my personal experiances while learning ML and Deep Learning. All will contain various examples and learning. 

This repo is mainly for myself to recollect and also share my journey and experiances with Deep Learning.

=====

### Keras ###
I found keras easy to start with when working with M/L and understand basics of neural networks. 
- [Keras 101](keras/Keras_First_Neural_Net_101.ipynb)
- [Keras Simple CNN and VGG16 Transfer Learning](keras/keras_very_simple_cnn_and_vgg16_transfer_learning.ipynb)
- [Keras NLP Text Classification With Simple FF Network Word2Vec + TF-IDF] (keras/simple_FF_deep_learning_classifier_with_word2vec_embedding_+_TF_IDF.ipynb) 

### ML ###
Various expriments with Data Science and ML
